                        Hi! <br>
                        My name is Safiya and being a bored college sudent I find myself spending a lot of time on Netflix, <br>
                        watching everything it has to offer. However, I do know that I should spend my time focussing on uni <br>
                        so this blog serves as an outlet for me to ask myself the question:
                        <h4>Was the time I spent not studying worth it to watch this film/series?</h4> 
                        I will rate the films and series I watched based on the folllowing criteria:
                        <ul>
                            <li><i><b>Originality:</b></i> Is the story fresh and unique, or does it feel derivative?</li>
                            <li><i><b>Coherence:</b></i> Does the plot make sense, and are there logical inconsistencies?</li>
                            <li><i><b>Pacing:</b></i> Is the story well-paced, or does it drag in places?</li>
                            <li><i><b>Genre:</b></i> Does it deliver what was promised?</li>
                            <li><i><b>Re-watchability:</b></i> Is it something I'd watch again, and does it hold up on subsequent viewings?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <b>Disclaimer:</b><br>
                        I think you've already guessed it, but I will only rank films and series that are available on Netflix. <br>
                        My rating here is highly subjective of course as it is my personal blog. Feel free to disagree ^^' <br>
                        The films and series will be arranged alphabetically and the little number above them is just for aesthetics :] <br>
                        Also, I really like comedic stuff, so most of these films and series will be (at least partially) under the Comedy tag.

                                <li><b>Coherence:</b><i> The story is consistent throughout and has a sort of looping end that ties the 
                                    beginning and finale of the movie together.</i></li>
                                <li><b>Pacing:</b><i> Although it's pretty time consuming being almost 3h long, I feel like that it's 
                                    needed to explain the science behind it.</i></li>

                                    to the Ocean's 11, 12, 13 etc. films with George Clooney.</i></li>
                                <li><b>Coherence:</b><i> It is coherent and I like that the regisseur played with the flashbacks to 
                                    enrich the story as it moves along.</i></li>

                                    watch. I've rewatched it multiple times already but mostly as backround noise for other tasks.
